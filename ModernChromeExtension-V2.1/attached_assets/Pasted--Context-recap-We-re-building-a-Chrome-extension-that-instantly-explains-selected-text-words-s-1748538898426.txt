*Context (recap):*
We're building a Chrome extension that instantly explains selected text (words, sentences, paragraphs) using the GPT-3.5-turbo model via OpenAIâ€™s API.

---

## ðŸ“Œ *Core Requirements (Reiterated & Updated):*

* *Trigger:*
  Automatically activate when user selects (highlights) text on any webpage.

* *Action:*
  Immediately show a small popup positioned directly next to the highlighted text, displaying an easy-to-understand GPT-generated explanation.

* *Explanation Details (Always Follow Exactly):*

  plaintext
  "Give a clear explanation of the following text in a simple and easy way within 50 words:
  {selected_text_here}"
  

  * Use *GPT-3.5-turbo* model (fast API response prioritized).

* *Popup UI/UX:*

  * Compact and minimalistic design (rounded corners, subtle shadow, neutral background).
  * Slightly larger than the reference image (attached earlier) to comfortably fit a 50-word explanation.
  * Close button (âœ•) at the top-right corner.
  * Automatically dismiss when clicking anywhere outside the popup.
  * Include a small link:
    "Explain more (Open advanced GPT)"
    Opens standard ChatGPT (GPT-4o) interface in a new browser tab.

## âœ… *Additional Implementation Details (Clearly Specified for GPT-4o Mini High):*

### â‘  *Manifest & Permissions (Important!):*

* Clearly specify entries in manifest.json:

  * Content scripts matching pattern: "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
  * Permissions explicitly set to "permissions": ["scripting"]
  * Host permissions set clearly for OpenAI API:

    json
    "host_permissions": ["https://api.openai.com/*"]
    

### â‘¡ *Error Handling (Robustness):*

* Handle OpenAI API failures gracefully:

  * If API call fails, popup must display a clear, user-friendly message like:
    "Couldn't fetch explanation. Try again later."

### â‘¢ *Debounce Implementation (Efficiency & UX):*

* Implement debounce logic with a delay of *300 ms*.

  * Ensures small adjustments to selected text do not trigger unnecessary multiple API calls.
  * Clear logic:
    "Wait 300ms after the user stops selecting text before triggering API call."

### â‘£ *Styling & Z-Index (Visual Clarity):*

* Popup CSS should explicitly set a high z-index (e.g. z-index: 9999) to guarantee it always appears above webpage content and is never obscured.

## ðŸ–¥ *Clearly Recommended Functions (Code Structure):*

* getSelectedText(): Retrieves highlighted text.
* createPopup(text, x, y): Generates and positions popup box correctly.
* fetchGPTExplanation(prompt): API logic to interact with OpenAI API, handle responses, and failures.
* closePopup(): Closes and removes popup neatly.
